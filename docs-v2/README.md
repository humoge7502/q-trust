# Q-Trust docs-v2 (VitePress)

Next-generation documentation site for [Q-Trust](https://github.com/humoge7502/q-trust) —
VitePress + native Mermaid diagrams + brand theme (cyan/violet on `#0D1117`).
Staged alongside the live mkdocs site; the switchover runbook is in
[MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md). Nothing here affects production until you run it.

## Quick start

```bash
cd docs-v2
npm install
npm run docs:dev      # dev server at http://localhost:5173/q-trust/
npm run docs:build    # production build → .vitepress/dist
npm run docs:preview  # preview the production build
```

## Expected images in `public/`

The site references three brand images that are **provided by the design-kit
assets** (copy them into `docs-v2/public/` before the production switch):

- `public/hero.png` — home-page hero illustration
- `public/logo.png` — site logo (nav/sidebar)
- `public/og-github.png` — social preview image (also referenced by the
  absolute URL in `.vitepress/config.ts`)

They are intentionally not committed with this skeleton.
