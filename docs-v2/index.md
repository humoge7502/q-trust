## How it fits together

Q-Trust connects discovery to provable action: the inspector turns your
cryptographic estate into a machine-readable CBOM, the GNN planner ranks what
to migrate first, and the on-chain registries make the result verifiable by
anyone — without gas for the submitter.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    tls["TLS / SSH endpoints"] --> insp["qtrust-inspector"]
    src["Source, manifests, binaries, PCAPs"] --> insp
    insp --> cbom["CycloneDX 1.7 CBOM"]
    cbom --> plan["GNN risk & migration plan"]
    plan --> relay["EIP-712 gasless relay"]
    relay --> chain["11 registries on Base L2"]
    chain --> ui["Dashboard & public verify pages"]
```

Scans produce evidence, plans order the work, and every registration lands on
Base L2 with a content-addressed hash — so a verifier can always re-derive the
answer from the CBOM. The whole path is designed to be reproducible: same
scan, same CBOM hash, same on-chain record.

::: tip Status — research / pre-release
Q-Trust is a solo-maintained research project. All numbers on this site are
measured in-repo (see [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/humoge7502/q-trust/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
and `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`), but the protocol is **not production ready**.
