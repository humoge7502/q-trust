 * real project ID — "demo" or missing is a deployment error and the build
 * must fail fast.
 *
 * FRESH CLONES: `next build` evaluates this module while prerendering static
 * pages, so the guard below fires even for local non-deployment builds. Copy
 * `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local` (the placeholder value is
 * fine for dev; real wallet connections need a project ID from
 * https://cloud.walletconnect.com) — or pass any non-'demo' value as
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID on the build command.
